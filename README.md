## Project Title

Image Photoplethysmography 

## Getting Started

This project tries extract heart rate of individual using video recording of face/hand in nature day light. 
The algorithm uses ICA to estimate R, G, B signals for FFT analysis to identify the heart rate frequency range.

## Framework used

Matlab

## Implementation

The inputs videos are recording at 30/60 fps in natural day light. 


## Input Video 

## Time series

## FFT Analysis  

## Heatmap for Heat rate measurement
